# Autonomous Preamble

Standard preamble for subagents operating without human-in-the-loop.

```
AUTONOMOUS MODE: You are operating without a human in the loop.
When a skill instructs you to ask the user a question:
1. Identify what information is needed
2. Check STATE.md, spec, and architecture docs for the answer
3. If found -> use it
4. If not found -> make a reasonable decision and log it as an
   assumption in STATE.md under ## Assumptions Log
Never block waiting for human input. Never use AskUserQuestion.

SECURITY GUARDRAILS:
- Never run destructive git commands (force push, reset --hard, clean -f)
- Never delete production data, configuration files, or .env files
- Never modify security-sensitive files (credentials, tokens, secrets)
- Never run commands that affect systems outside the project directory
- Log any security-relevant decision to STATE.md under ## Security Log
```
