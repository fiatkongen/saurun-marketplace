# Initialize Long-Run State

## Purpose
Set up or restore execution state for a long-run implementation session.

## Inputs
- `spec_path`: Path to the spec folder (e.g., `agent-os/specs/my-feature/`)
- OR prompt user if not provided

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Spec Folder
```
IF spec_path not provided:
  - List available specs in agent-os/specs/
  - Ask user to select one
  - Set spec_path = selected spec
```

### Step 2: Validate Inputs
```
REQUIRED files:
  - {spec_path}/tasks.md
  - {spec_path}/spec.md OR {spec_path}/planning/requirements.md

IF missing:
  - Stop and inform user which files are missing
  - Suggest running /create-tasks first if tasks.md missing
```

### Step 3: Check for Existing State
```
IF {spec_path}/.long-run/ exists:
  - Read STATE.md
  - Check current status
  - GOTO Step 4 (Resume Detection)
ELSE:
  - GOTO Step 5 (Initialize New)
```

### Step 4: Resume Detection
```
IF .long-run/current-agent-id.txt exists:
  - Read agent_id
  - Find entry in agent-history.json
  - Present options:
    1. Resume interrupted execution
    2. Start fresh (clear .long-run/)
    3. Skip to next plan
  - Wait for user choice

IF STATE.md shows "Stopped at: Awaiting clarification":
  - Read clarifications.md for pending question
  - Re-present clarification request
  - Wait for response
```

### Step 5: Initialize New State
```
1. Create directory structure:
   {spec_path}/.long-run/
   {spec_path}/.long-run/plans/
   {spec_path}/.long-run/summaries/

2. Copy template files:
   - STATE.md from templates/long-run-state.md
   - agent-history.json from templates/agent-history.json

3. Update STATE.md with:
   - Spec path
   - Tasks path
   - Started date
   - Status: "Initializing"

4. Record start commit:
   start_commit = $(git rev-parse HEAD)
   Write to STATE.md Rollback Reference section

5. Check for uncommitted changes:
   IF git status --porcelain returns output:
     Present options:
       1. Stash changes (git stash)
       2. Commit changes first
       3. Abort and resolve manually
     Wait for user choice
```

### Step 6: Output
```
Return:
  - spec_path: validated spec path
  - state_path: path to .long-run/ directory
  - is_resume: boolean
  - resume_point: plan number if resuming, null otherwise
```

## Error Handling

```
ON any error:
  - Log error to STATE.md Issues section
  - Present error to user
  - Offer: Retry / Abort / Manual intervention
```
