# Codex Bridge

Call OpenAI's Codex CLI to get responses, reviews, or perform tasks.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user says things like:
- "Ask Codex...", "Have Codex...", "Let Codex..."
- "Get GPT's opinion on...", "What does OpenAI think..."
- "Get a second opinion on..."
- "Have Codex review..."
- "Let Codex fix/refactor/implement..."

## How to Call Codex

**Basic command:**
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/plugins/saurun/skills/codex-bridge/codex-bridge.mjs" "<prompt>"
```

**With file modification capabilities:**
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/plugins/saurun/skills/codex-bridge/codex-bridge.mjs" "<prompt>" --full-auto
```

## Decision Logic

### Use READ-ONLY mode (no flags) when:
- User wants an opinion, explanation, or review
- User wants to compare perspectives
- User is asking questions
- Task is about analysis, not modification

### Use `--full-auto` mode when:
- User explicitly asks Codex to fix, refactor, or implement something
- User wants Codex to make changes to files
- Words like "fix", "refactor", "implement", "update", "change" are used

## Handling File Reviews

When user wants Codex to review a file:

1. Read the file content first using the Read tool
2. Include the content in the prompt to Codex
3. Structure the prompt clearly

Example:
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/plugins/saurun/skills/codex-bridge/codex-bridge.mjs" "Review this planning document and provide feedback on feasibility, risks, and suggestions:

---
[FILE CONTENT HERE]
---"
```

## Response Format

Always present Codex's response clearly:

**For opinions/reviews:**
> **Codex (OpenAI) says:**
> [response]

**For comparisons:**
Provide both my analysis and Codex's response, noting any differences.

**For file modifications:**
After Codex completes, show what changed using `git status` or `git diff`.

## Examples

**User:** "Have Codex review my planning doc at docs/plan.md"
**Action:**
1. Read docs/plan.md
2. Call codex-bridge with the content asking for review
3. Present feedback

**User:** "Get a second opinion from GPT on this architecture"
**Action:**
1. Call codex-bridge with the architecture question
2. Present both perspectives

**User:** "Let Codex fix the TypeScript errors"
**Action:**
1. Call codex-bridge with `--full-auto`
2. Show what files changed

## How It Works

The bridge handles CLI length limits intelligently:

1. **Input**: Short prompts (<7000 chars) pass directly as CLI args. Long prompts write to `.codex-bridge-prompt.txt`
2. **Output**: Response captured via `--output-last-message` temp file
3. **Cleanup**: Temp files automatically deleted after execution
4. **Timeout**: 20 minutes (1,200,000ms) default

This allows sending large file contents for review without hitting Windows' 8191 character CLI limit.

## Prerequisites

- Codex CLI installed: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Codex authenticated: `codex login`
