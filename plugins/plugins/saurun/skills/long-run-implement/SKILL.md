# Long-Run Implement

Transform task specifications into executable plans and run them autonomously with minimal checkpoints, per-task atomic commits, and full state persistence.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user says things like:
- "Implement this plan autonomously"
- "Run long-run implementation"
- "Execute these tasks with minimal interruption"
- "Implement the spec with atomic commits"

## What This Skill Does

1. **Initialize** - Set up or restore execution state
2. **Transform** - Convert tasks into enriched PLAN.md files
3. **Execute** - Run plans sequentially with subagents
4. **Finalize** - Present summary and verification options

## Key Features

- **Minimal Checkpoints** - Only stops for genuine blockers (architectural changes, external actions, unrecoverable errors)
- **Per-Task Atomic Commits** - Each completed task is committed immediately with conventional commit format
- **Full Persistence** - All state saved to disk; resume anytime from interruption point
- **Automatic Deviation Handling** - Auto-fix minor issues; log enhancements to ISSUES.md

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Initialize
See [phases/1-initialize.md](phases/1-initialize.md)

- Locate and validate spec folder
- Check for existing state (resume detection)
- Initialize .long-run/ directory structure
- Pre-flight checks (clean working tree)

### Phase 2: Transform
See [phases/2-transform.md](phases/2-transform.md)

- Parse tasks.md structure
- Enrich each task group with:
  - Specific file paths
  - Detailed action steps with "what to avoid and WHY"
  - Executable verification commands
  - Measurable done criteria
- Generate PLAN.md files
- If too vague: stop and ask for clarification

### Phase 3: Execute
See [phases/3-execute.md](phases/3-execute.md)

- Execute plans sequentially
- Spawn subagent for each plan (agent type from orchestration.yml)
- Handle deviations automatically where possible
- Per-task atomic commits
- Update checkpoints after each task

### Phase 4: Finalize
See [phases/4-finalize.md](phases/4-finalize.md)

- Aggregate results from all summaries
- Present completion report
- Offer verification and cleanup options

## Stop Conditions

| Condition | Phase | What Happens |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Task group too vague | Transform | Asks for clarification |
| Architectural decision needed | Execute | Presents decision with options |
| External action needed | Execute | Provides instructions, waits |
| Error after 3 retries | Execute | Offers retry/skip/abort |

## File Structure (Runtime)

├── spec.md                    # Input
├── tasks.md                   # Input (updated with checkboxes)

        ├── 01-SUMMARY.md      # Completion summaries

```

## Commit Format

```
{type}({plan}): {task-name}
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`

## Resume Capability

If execution is interrupted, invoke this skill again on the same spec. It will:
1. Detect existing state
2. Find last checkpoint
3. Offer resume options
4. Continue from where it left off

## Orchestration Integration

This skill integrates with `orchestration.yml` to enable specialized agents per task group.

### How It Works

1. **orchestrate-tasks** (upstream) creates `{spec_path}/orchestration.yml`:
   ```yaml
   task_groups:
     - name: authentication-system
       claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
     - name: user-dashboard
       claude_code_subagent: frontend-specialist
   ```

2. **plan-fixer** (called per task group) adds metadata to PLAN.md:
   - Reads orchestration.yml
   - Adds frontmatter with `task_group` and `claude_code_subagent`

3. **long-run-implement Phase 3** spawns the correct agent:
   - Reads orchestration.yml
   - Looks up `task_group` from PLAN.md frontmatter
   - Finds matching `claude_code_subagent`
   - Spawns that agent type instead of "general-purpose"

### Agent Resolution

Agents are resolved from the PROJECT's `.claude/agents/` folder:

```
orchestration.yml: claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
  → .claude/agents/backend-specialist.md
```

If the agent is not found in orchestration.yml or orchestration.yml doesn't exist, the fallback is `"general-purpose"`.

**Note:** Agents in `.claude/agents/` have their own hard-coded references to the standards they need. No separate standards embedding is required.

Example PLAN.md structure:
```markdown
---
task_group: authentication-system
claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
---

<task name="implement-login">
...
</task>
```

## Agent

Uses the `long-run-executor` agent to execute individual PLAN.md files.
