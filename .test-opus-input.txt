You are testing as an Opus model for react-implementer-prompt skill evaluation.

Generate a structured dispatch prompt for this React implementation task:

**Task 3: Add Product Filter Component**
- Create a ProductFilter component in components/products/
- Filter by category (dropdown), price range (dual slider), and availability (checkbox)
- Use Zustand productStore for filter state
- Apply filters on client side (filter products array)
- Reset button clears all filters
- Mobile responsive (stack vertically on sm)

**Context:**
- Stack: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Zustand
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW
- Working directory: /Users/dev/shopping-app/frontend
- Dependencies: Task 1 (ProductList component) is already complete

Your dispatch prompt must include these 7 sections:
1. Task Description (full task text, not reference)
2. Context (stack, directory, dependencies)
3. Before You Begin (pre-checks)
4. Your Job (reference saurun:react-tdd and saurun:react-tailwind-v4-components)
5. TDD Workflow (must say "REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Follow saurun:react-tdd")
6. Self-Review (5 categories: Completeness, Quality, Discipline, Testing, Tailwind v4)
7. Report Format (5 outputs: what implemented, test results, files changed, self-review findings, issues/concerns)

Generate the complete dispatch prompt.
